# MEME LEARNING

Ok, this is dumb, I know, but I want to get my hands dirty on something fancy.

I've downloaded a bunch of memes from a popular site (link in code) and try to fit a model for multiclass classification.
* **SPOILER 0x1**: the problem is super easy, beacuse all memes are very representative for themself AND basically all the images are the same except the caption;
* **SPOILER 0x2**: I WANT TO TRY SIMPLE THINGS.

Having said that, you may want to have a look at the code...
