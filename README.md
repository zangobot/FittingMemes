# MEME CLASSIFICATION

Ok, this is dumb, I know, but I want to get my hands dirty on something fancy.

I've downloaded a bunch of memes from a popular site (link in code) and try to fit a model for multiclass classification.
* **SPOILER 0x01**: the problem is super easy, beacuse all memes are very representative for themself AND basically all the images are the same except the caption;
* **SPOILER 0x10**: I WANT TO TRY SIMPLE THINGS.
* **SPOILER 0x11**: I'm not a super expert but an enthusiast... so feel free to let me know if there is something wrong ;-)

Having said that, you may want to have a look at the code... or the [notebook](https://github.com/zangobot/FittingMemes/blob/master/Why%3F.ipynb) I'm creating!
